title: Why Flappy Bird is So Hard

I tried to play Flappy Bird, but it was hard. I tried multiple times,
only got best score of 7.

**Flappy Bird looks nothing innovative as compared to other ones like
JetPack. But why is it so hard?**

Not until I wrote [my own flappy
bird](https://github.com/kkspeed/racket-flappy), which I call
racket-flappy, did I realized what was behind flappy bird. I was so
surprised that in my own version of flappy bird, I could get 10+
passes.

Then I looked at the physics side. In my own version, the bird has a
vertical speed v, a vertical position y and gravity g. v is influenced
by g and y is affected by v, a common sense in high-school
physics. Upon clicking, the bird’s vertical speed v is boosted by a
fixed number. In other words, the click gives the bird an
impulse. It's a simplified version of the formula m\*v = F\*t, where m
is the mass of bird, F is the force applied to bird and t is the time
frame. Such model conforms to physics and should give no surprise to
players.

But then it goes differently in the original version of flappy
bird. Upon clicking, the bird is not boosted by an impulse. Instead,
its vertical speed changed to zero and vertical position is increased
by fixed amount! WTF… That surprises me a lot and you cannot smoothly
control the bird anymore. By clicking, the bird’s vertical position
changes dramatically and that causes most attempts to fail! Ah… What
an anti-humanity game, Flappy Bird!
